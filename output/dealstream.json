Today, the Company is known and respected for its production of precision-molded foam products and custom-designed molds.\r\rCustomer applications include precision floats, insulators, structural parts, wafers, fiber coil management, and more. Sixty years of servicing this macro environment and providing these specialty items have created a reputation in the industry for innovation and quality.\r\rThe many molds are included with the sale. Some are for exterior boxes which will enable ongoing opportunities for a Buyer thanks to the ability to make thousands more custom projects for minimal cost.\r\rWhile others in the industry (more commodity-oriented products) sell for 2-3 material costs, this operation easily sells at 10 x material costs.\r\rIts efficient, compliant facility and group of dedicated employees make this a turn-key opportunity to keep a legacy operation going.\r\rThe Seller has a 15-point transition plan to ensure the success of a transaction.\r\r\rDetailed Information\r\rFacilities: The custom-fitted space, that meets all air quality standards, is 27,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space. The current lease extends through 2026. Rent is $9,400 per month.\r\rCompetition: The molded foam industry has three distinct segments. This operation falls under shape molding which produces custom packaging and components.\r\rMost direct competitors use large steam chests, resulting in products with vent marks across the surface.\r\rThe difference in cleanroom manufacturing is the quality and the production of a truly smooth surface finish. This company’s reputation is built on its premier ability to mold small, thin parts, and caters to those who demand such quality, like medical applications.\r\rThose that produce rough surfaced parts are not competitors.\r\rGrowth & Expansion: The Seller has a detailed outline of steps to increase sales and expand the previously dormant marketing plan by seeking new medical and component applications.\r\rHe also foresees opportunities for high-density foams as replacements for thermoforms, fabricated urethane, and injection molded parts.\r\rAn aggressive marketing plan would include reinstating trade show participation. Initiating SEO would also bring in additional prospects when orders increase, adding a third production shift would increase capacity.\r\rFinancing: TBD if the deal structure and terms are acceptable.\r\rSupport & Training: The Seller wishes to facilitate a successful and smooth transfer of the Business and will offer assistance and support as needed.\r\rReason for Selling: It is time to retire."], "broker-phone": "", "broker-name": ""},

A large investment group signed a Letter of Intent To Purchase early on, thus removing the opportunity from the marketplace.

Therefore, this terrific opportunity is now again available for purchase.\r\rOur Client’s business and profits continue to expand.  They have re-listed this purchase opportunity at $3M (USD).  This sale price, based on current revenues, growth and profits, should be recovered by a Buyer in short order.\r\rPlease do not respond to this opportunity unless you will provide proof of funds prior to any demos or negotiations; i.e. the capability to make an acquisition of $3M dollar (USD).
